Lifecycle hooks in Angular are methods that Angular calls at specific stages of a component's lifecycle. These hooks give developers the opportunity to tap into key moments in the lifecycle of a component or directive, allowing them to perform custom logic during these stages. Here's a summary of the primary lifecycle hooks in Angular:

1 . ngOnChanges:

Purpose: Called when any data-bound property of a directive changes.
Use Case: Respond to changes to input properties.
Signature: ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void

2.ngOnInit:

Purpose: Called once, after the first ngOnChanges.
Use Case: Initialize the directive or component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive or component's input properties.
Signature: ngOnInit(): void

3.ngDoCheck:

Purpose: Called during every change detection run, immediately after ngOnChanges and ngOnInit.
Use Case: Detect and act upon changes that Angular cannot or will not detect on its own.
Signature: ngDoCheck(): void

4.ngAfterContentInit:

Purpose: Called once after the first ngDoCheck.
Use Case: Respond after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
Signature: ngAfterContentInit(): void

5.ngAfterContentChecked:

Purpose: Called after ngAfterContentInit and every subsequent ngDoCheck.
Use Case: Respond after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
Signature: ngAfterContentChecked(): void

6.ngAfterViewInit:

Purpose: Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked.
Use Case: Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
Signature: ngAfterViewInit(): void

7.ngAfterViewChecked:

Purpose: Called after the ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked.
Use Case: Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
Signature: ngAfterViewChecked(): void

8.ngOnDestroy:

Purpose: Called immediately before Angular destroys the directive or component.
Use Case: Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive or component, such as unsubscribing from Observables and detaching event handlers.
Signature: ngOnDestroy(): void
